# abstract
This paper delves into the intricate interplay between behavioral economics principles and the internal knowledge sharing processes within organizations. In a world where knowledge is increasingly recognized as a strategic asset, understanding the impact of behavioral economics on the dissemination of hidden internal knowledge holds paramount importance.

This research aims to unravel the nuanced connections between behavioral economics theories and the extent to which individuals within organizations are cognizant of the volume and economic value of concealed internal knowledge.
